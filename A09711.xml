            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let her uſe choice Meats, of eaſie and light Concoction, engendring good blood or juice; let her abſtain from hot aromatical Spices, as Pepper, Ginger, Cardamum, and ſuch like; alſo from Leeks, Onions, Garlick, Salt, auſtere and tart things; Let her avoid ſtrong Wines, as alſo cold Water: Let her eſchew immoderate eating and drinking, for that corrupteth the Milk, and begetteth in Children leproſy or ſcurf, and other contagious Diſeaſes: Let her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Cares and Vexations, and let her take heed, leſt ſhe provoke her menſtruous Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>She muſt not Sleep much, or be given to Sleep, for that maketh the Milk Flegmatick; ſhe ought not to watch more than is meet, for from hence the Milk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be more hot, ſharp, and diſtaſtful to the Infant; ſhe ought moderately to exerciſe her ſelf, eſpecially her Arms, to wit, either in ſowing, ſpinning, or knitting for by this means evil humours are conſumed, as by eaſe and ſloth they are augmented.</p>
               <p>Alſo Copulation of the Nurſe exceedingly offendeth, and hurteth the Child, as that which chiefly retracteth and deminiſheth the Milk, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Food muſt be daily given them thrice a day, till they are 3 Years old; for if they be much filled, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and accuſtomed to be troubled with Convulſions, and other Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth or ſeventh Year of their Age, they are to be ſent to School, and committed to the breeding and inſtruction of courteous and temperate School-maſters, who may not terrifie them.</p>
                  <p>Before theſe Years, they are not to be compelled or forced to hard Labours, otherwiſe they will not thrive well, but ſtand at a ſtay and keep little, or elſe become Dwarfs.</p>
                  <p>When as the Infant beginneth to grow ſick, as for example, from a cold Diſeaſe, the Nurſe is to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with hot and dry Meat and Drink, ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forthwith it may grow well again; ſo alſo if it be taken with other Diſeaſes, as with an <hi>Ague,</hi> the Nurſe ſhall uſe <hi>Plantain-water,</hi> and ſuch like things. Paps made for Children of Crums, or Morſels of Bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or ſliced, are more wholeſome than made of Meal or Flower.</p>
                  <p>Till 2 Years old give them <hi>Honey</hi> often, for that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them from Convulſions, and Coſtiveneſs of the Belly, and that the Milk they eat hurt them not.</p>
                  <p>When Infants caſt up their Milk, a Corral ſhould be hung about their Neck, down to their middle; for it is uſeful for them in teething; and Ivory alſo is good for the ſame purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>Trees, like Mortals, are ſubject to many Diſtempers, which ſometimes prove Deadly and Epidemical: But, as to Trees, the Diſtempers they are incident to, are chiefly cauſed by <hi>Earth-Worms, Canker, Gum, Robines, Emmets, Green Fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, Garden-Mice, Laires, Ear-Wiggs, Caterpillars, Snails, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt whereof lye at the Roots, and gnaw ſo violently the Stem, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Tree Sickens and Dyes immediately. Now to prevent and Cure this Diſeaſe, you muſt be ſure (ſo ſoon as you perceive the Plant to droop) to uncover the foot thereof, ſhorten the gnaw'd Roots thereof,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3596:83"/>ſearch for, and pick carefully all the Worms out, and lay freſh wholeſom Mold thereto; which will in a little time help.— But if your Tree hath a <hi>Canker,</hi> draw your Knife, and with the point thereof, cut it out clearly, and clap immediately ſome Cow-Dung or Hogs-Dung, and wrap it round with a Rag, and the Skin or Rhind will grow again. — If <hi>Gum</hi> hath faſtned to the Bud, Graft, or Stem of your Trees, it is incurable; but if 'tis only fix'd on the Branch, the Cure may be effected, by cutting it off 2 or 3 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches below the aggrieved part. — As for <hi>Caterpillers, Emmets, Robines, &amp;c.</hi> they muſt be pick'd and carefully bruſhed off. But if your Tree ſickens by reaſon it's Branches are too heavy, give it eaſe, by lowering the Top-branches, or thoſe diſorderly ones in the middle, and it will again produce fine ſhoots. Finally, the only way to prevent 'em from being gnaw'd or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by
<hi>Garden-Mice,</hi> and <hi>Rats,</hi> is to ſet Traps and Snares to catch
'em.</p>

Firſt then, it muſt be made in a place much expos'd to the Sun; where drive Stakes into the Earth, near 4 Foot diſtance, in breadth at the Ends, and for the length take your own Fancy, fill up both ends and ſides, with Wooden Stakes, almoſt a Yard above Ground; let each ſtake be drawn a foot Diſtance, and wound about with ſtraw Ropes; then Fling in your <hi>Horſe-dung,</hi> and Wet Litter, till it riſes 2 Foot upon a Level; then Tread it down, and Raiſe it ſo much more, and Tread down again, till it's almoſt the Heighth; next Nail ſome ſmall Boards all round on the Top, to keep in the fine ſifted Earth, which muſt be 5 Inches deep: Stick <hi>Hazle-Rods</hi> Arching over it, like an Arbour, ſtrong enough to ſupport <hi>Mats,</hi> or <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> to make it Heat; and obſerve ſo ſoon as the Extream Heat is over (which you may obſerve by feeling it blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm) to ſow your Seeds. Note, if you are afraid, your Horſe-dung wont Heat, fling it Light up, and Mix therein Sea-coal, and it will Heat at your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve likewiſe in <hi>November,</hi> to ſtop all Creviſes in your Green-houſes, that no cold may come in, to which end, lay ſtraw Mats, <hi/> and if it ſhould happen to Freeze, ſet a Pan of Charcoal in the Middle. And if your Plants be very Dry, and the Weather is not Extream, water them Moderately; Mingling your Water in a little Sheeps Dung, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But beſure you Wet not the Leaves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; leſt the Cold Chill and ſtrike to the Heart thereof.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Directions I have laid down, yet if your Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not duely Water'd, it is all Labour in Vain; To prevent which, take theſe few Obſervations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you have a foreſight of Drowth, begin to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Earth is too dry; but for Plants uſe not Well-water, for it is ſo ſtrained thorough the Earth, or rather barren Sands or Rocks, and for want of the Sun ſo chill and cold, that having no Nouriſhment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, doth more hurt than good; Rivers that run quick and long on ſharp Gravel are little better, but if you are forced to uſe ſuch, let it ſtand ſome time in Tubs in the Sun, mixed with Dung. Let the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and quality of the Dung mixed with the Water, be according to the Nature of your Plants; if your Plants be great growers and require heat, then put Horſe-dung in your Water: If your Water be bad, then put Dung into it to help it; let it ſtand in the Sun and open Air uncovered: If your Plants be fine and tender, then put
<hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Cows</hi> dung, <hi>Deer</hi> or <hi>Aſſes</hi> dung into the Water; the worſe the Ground and more barren, be ſure to put in the more dung. Take care you Water no Plants with ſtanding ſtinking Ditch-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor no Water that ſtinketh; for ſweet Water (not too clear) and freſh Mould (not muſty or tainted by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3596:86"/>Weeds) is as proper for tender Plants, as ſweet and good Food, warm and clean Lodging, for tender and fine bred Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Rain-water is very good if not too long kept, but if your Veſſel be large, the oftener you ſtir it, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it will keep ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Large and Navigable Rivers, that receive much Soil by waſhing Streets, and the many ſinks that run into it, and which, by its motion, doth cleanſe it ſelf from that which is Noxious, both to Man and Plants, is an excellent Water for all ſorts of Plants.</p>
                  <p>The larger the Ponds be, the better the Water is for Plants, the opener to the Sun the better, the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have, by Horſes waſhing in them, or Geeſe and Ducks ſwimming; 'tis ſo much the better.</p>
                  <p>Water all Seeds with the ſmalleſt or Rain-like drops you can, and not to much at a time or too fiercely, leſt you diſcover them.</p>
                  <p>For Flowers and Plants whoſe Leaves lie on the Ground, water them at ſome diſtance, by making a hollow Circle about the Plant, and pouring Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, by which means you avoid annoying the Leaves, by diſcolouring Water, or chilling the Roots by too ſudden Coldneſs.</p>
                  <p>In Summer-time, or all warm Seaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Evening is beſt for watering, becauſe the Water will have time to ſink in the Earth, and the Plant attract it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun's heat exhales it: But in Winter or cold Weather, the Morning is the moſt proper time, that the ſuperfluous moiſture may be evaporated 'ere the cold Night overtake you, and Chill perhaps kill a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plant.</p>
                  <p>A drooping Plant, that you think Water will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, may be watered by Filtration, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſet an earthen or wooden Veſſel on a Brick, full of Water, near your Plant, that all the Water may be higher than the Earth, wet a thick woollen Liſt, put one end, with a Stone or bit of Lead, into the Water, that it may keep to the bottom; lay the other end on the Ground, near
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3596:86"/>the Root of the Plant, and the Water will diſtil out of the Bowl or Pot through the Liſt.</p>
